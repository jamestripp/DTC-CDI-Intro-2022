# Centre for Digital Inquiry {background-color="#552d62"}

## CDI

"We use and develop digital research techniques and associated tools to advance knowledge about culture and society ('thinking with' the digital), while also taking up the digital as a substantive critical topic ('thinking through' the digital)."

# Digital Methods {background-color="#2780e3"}

## APIs

-   "Digital methods are techniques for the study of societal change and cultural condition with online data. They make use of available digital objects such as the hyperlink, tag, timestamp, like, share, retweet, and seek to learn from how the objects are treated by the methods built into the dominant devices online, such as Google Web Search and Facebook's Graph Search." @rogers2015

. . .

-   "This paper introduces the 4CAT Capture and Analysis Toolkit (4CAT), an open-source Web-based research tool. 4CAT can capture data from a variety of online sources (including Twitter, Telegram, Reddit, 4chan, 8kun, BitChute, Douban and Parler) and analyze them through analytical processors." @peeters2022 , [GitHub](https://github.com/digitalmethodsinitiative/4cat)

## AI

-   Living with machines. "The project brings together historians, data scientists, geographers, computational linguists, and curators to devise new methods in data science and artificial intelligence that can be applied to historical resources, producing tools and software to analyse digitised collections at scale." [project web site](https://livingwithmachines.ac.uk/)

## Computational Programming

-   Typical inferential statistics [Linear Regression tutorial](https://mlu-explain.github.io/linear-regression/)

## Digital Humanities

-   Distant reading. Distant reading is an approach in literary studies that applies computational methods to literary data, usually derived from large digital libraries, for the purposes of literary history and theory. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distant_reading), @moretti2013

. . .

-   Critical Digital Humanities. Can established humanities methods coexist with computational thinking? @dobson2019
